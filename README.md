# sales-forecast-time-series
This project aims to predict one year of future sales/revenue value with historical transaction data.

For confidential issue, the dataset used this project will not be provided.
However, the code should work for data in similar structure:
- 6 years of historical transaction data with attributes: date, sales
- no missing dates


You should have at least three years of data to work with the model.
